# odin-recipes
Hi! My name is Elli. I'm an an aspiring developer based out of Kitchener, Canada (home of the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany!).

I've been following The Odin Project while committing to a 100 Days of Code challenge (as of today, August 13th, I am on Day 2!) and this will be one of my first true projects while working through TOP. 

I look forward to sharing some delicious recipes with you, while improving my web development skills. 

Let's get started!
