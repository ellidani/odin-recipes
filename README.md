# odin-recipes
Hi! My name is Elli. I'm an an aspiring developer based out of Kitchener, Canada (home of the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany!).

I've been following The Odin Project while committing to a 100 Days of Code challenge (as of today, August 13th, I am on Day 2!) and this will be one of my first true projects while working through TOP. 

I look forward to sharing some delicious recipes with you, while improving my web development skills. 

Let's get started!

Reflection time!

I was able to complete the first project in the HTML Foundations of The Odin Project. When I was picking my recipes, I didn't intend to be all cakes, but here we are! What can I say, I love my eggs best when they are in cake. 

I can't wait to dust off some CSS and maybe come back to this project and make it look less... basic! All of this was done within an hour, so I'm sure with a bit more time dedicated, I could make these look better, but I'll be honest, I'm a bit more keen to move forward with The Odin Project as these skills I'll developer there will help build out the projects that are currently residing as dreams in my heart!

On to CSS Foundations!
