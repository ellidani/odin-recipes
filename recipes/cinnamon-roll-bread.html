        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            With swirls of cinnamon throughout, this bread will add a sweet touch to your mornings. This tastes best when served warm, so if it happens to last more than a day, I recommend warming slightly in the microwave or toaster oven and adding a touch of salted butter.
