        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The first time I made this zucchini bread was because I had gotten an amazing deal on zucchini at a farmer's market, but quite honestly, I almost never ate zucchini so I had no idea what to do with it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I made this loaf, it became an instant staple and turned me into a zucchini lover. This cake is so moist and flavorful. I've even given it to a vegetable-hating nephew who chowed down and asked for seconds. A surefire winner.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated zucchini, lightly packed (do not drain!)</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweeted apple sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil, or your preferred cooking oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oen to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Butter or spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the grated zucchini, sugar, brown sugar, apple sauce, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stire just until no dry flour remains, trying not to over mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-55 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out with moist crumbs on it.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Remove from the pan and transfer into the rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
            <li>Store covered in the refridgerator. This bread is best served after it has been refrigerated for at least 12 hours.</li>
        </ol>
