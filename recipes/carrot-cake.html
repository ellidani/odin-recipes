            <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1 pound finely-grated fresh carrots</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Frosting Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (8-ounce) bricks cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>6 cups powdered sugar (or more, if needed to thicken)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Grease and flour three 8-inch round baking pans.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Add in the eggs and vamilla, and whisk until smooth</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, whisk together the remaining dry ingredients (flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves) until combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry mixture into the egg mixture, and stir until smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold in the grated carrrots, and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Portion the batter evenly into the prepared baking pans.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Transfer the baking pans to a wire cooling rack and let the cakes cool until they reach room temperature.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, to make the cream cheese frosting, combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and stir until combined and smooth. (You can either do this with a spatula, or with a hand or stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Gradually stire in the powdered sugar and mix until it is well combined. You want the frosting to be pretty firm for a 3-layer cake, so add more/less powdered sugar as needed to reach the correct consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes reach room temperature, use a cake leveler or bread knife to slice off the rounded tops of the cakes so that they are completely flat on top.</li>
            <li>Place the first cake on your serving platter, add a large scoop of frosting on top of it, and spread the froasting so that it covers the cake evenly and extends a bit over the edges.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the second and third layers of the cake.</li>
            <li>Then use the remainder of the frosting to frost all around the sides of the cake.</li>
            <li>Once you're ready to serve the cake, slice it up and enjoy! This cake will also keep in the fridge for up to 4 days.</li>
        </ol>
